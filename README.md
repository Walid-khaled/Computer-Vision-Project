## Pick-and-Place-Object-detection-using-YOLO-on-KUKA
In this repository, we are going to address one of these operations, pick and place, which is the most widely used in production lines and assembly processes.
The aim of this project is to select 3 objects out of 6 objects in robot work environment, and place them in specific-colored regions, so that each object will be placed in
colored region initially specified by the operator.

The challenges of this project go as follow:
Object Detection: YOLOv4Â 
Box Detection:
                               - Color Segmentation in HSI
                               - Morphology operations
Pick and Place: 
                               - Object center and orientation 
                               - Box center and orientation
Localization w.r.t Robot Base:
                                                      - Eye-In-Hand Camera Calibration
                                                      - Transformations
Hardware Implementation:
                                                    - KUKA iiwa
                                                    - ROS
